        <p><b>Konark Sun Temple</b></p>
        <p>Konark Sun Temple is a 13th-century CE Sun temple at Konark about 35 kilometres northeast from Puri city on the coastline in Puri district, Odisha, India. The temple is attributed to king Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga dynasty about 1250 CE.</p>
        <p>Sun Temple of Konark, built in the middle of 13th century, is a massive conception of artistic magnificence and engineering dexterity. King Narasimhadeva I, the great ruler of the Ganga dynasty had built this temple, with the help of 1200 artisans within a period of 12 years (1243-1255 A.D.). Since the ruler used to worship the Sun, the temple was considered as a chariot for the Sun God. Konark Temple was designed in the form of a gorgeously decorated chariot mounted on 24 wheels , each about 10 feet in diameter, and drawn by 7 mighty horses. It is really difficult to understand, how this huge temple, every inch-space of which was so wonderfully carved, could have been completed within such a short time. Whatever that might be, the konark temple even in its present ruined state, still a wonder to the whole world. Great poet Rabindranath Tagore wrote of Konark: "Here the language of stone surpasses the language of man".</p>

    <p><b>Hampi</b></p>
    <p>Hampi is an ancient village in the south Indian state of Karnataka. It’s dotted with numerous ruined temple complexes from the Vijayanagara Empire. On the south bank of the River Tungabhadra is the 7th-century Hindu Virupaksha Temple, near the revived Hampi Bazaar. A carved stone chariot stands in front of the huge Vittala Temple site. Southeast of Hampi, Daroji Bear Sanctuary is home to the Indian sloth bear.</p>
    <p>The first settlement in Hampi dates back to the 1st century AD, and several Buddhist sites belonging to that time have been found nearby. Hampi was the capital of the mighty Vijayanagara Empire.

        Vijayanagara was one of the largest Hindu empires in India. Two brothers, Harihar and Bukka, founded it in 1336. Krishnadevaraya (1509-1529) was the greatest ruler and controlled almost all peninsular India south of the Tungabhadra River. The town of Hampi in the 14th century had a population of half a million people. Seven concentric lines of fortifications protected the city. It maintained a massive army to defend it from other kingdoms.
        
        Vijayanagara Empire flourished as it controlled both cotton and spice trade routes of southern India. Medieval historians refer to Hampi as an important center of trade. However, the glory of Vijayanagara was short-lived. With the death of Krishnadevaraya, the combined armies of the five Muslim kingdoms-Bidar, Bijapur, Golconda, Ahmednagar, and Berar-destroyed this mighty empire in 1565.</p>

    <p><b>Ruins of Nalanda University  </b></p>
    <p>Nalanda was a renowned mahavihara in ancient Magadha, eastern India. Considered by historians to be the world's first residential university and among the greatest centers of learning in the ancient world, it was located near the city of Rajagriha and about 90 kilometres southeast of Pataliputra.</p>
    <p>Nalanda Mahavihara, located in the state of Bihar was an ancient university. The site saw continuous habitation from the 3rd century BCE till the 13th century CE. The remains of devotional, funerary and residential structures cover an area of about 23 hectares. The scholastic institute founded by the Gupta King, Kumaragupta, in the late 5th century CE housed thousands of scholars and teachers in its heyday. The site was chosen as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2016.

        The Mahavihara is an example of the tradition of rain retreats of the Buddhist monks developing into centres for teaching and learning, which was quite unlike the ancient Brahmanical system of a Gurukul, where the student received education at the home of the teacher. A Buddhist University, established by a Hindu king, Nalanda welcomed in its fold students belonging to various faiths and regions of the world. They were admitted after passing a strict oral examination and were taught a variety of subjects.
        
        The Chinese scholar Hiuen Tsang (Xuanzang) and others who followed him to Nalanda, have left behind accounts about the university which give valuable information about the subjects taught, the university administration, and the daily routine of the students. They carried back a large number of manuscripts and books, which gives evidence of the existence of a well-stocked library at Nalanda.
        
        The university supported itself from the revenues of about 100 villages which were granted to it by kings, and the generous donations made by patrons, both Indian and foreign. Such monetary patronage may have led the university to provide free education and residence to most of its students.
        
        The vast amount of archaeological remains at the site comprise the famous Nalanda stupa, a tall brick structure built on a high base, which was successively enlarged seven times. The monastery and other structures built here, unlike elsewhere, were well laid out in a linear axial pattern. The antiquities unearthed here testify to the skills of Indian craftsmen in working with stone, stucco and metals.
        
        After continuously imparting education for about 800 years, Nalanda was destroyed in an attack by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji in the 13th century CE. The destruction had a two-fold impact. On the one hand it hastened the decline of Buddhism in India, which was already facing the onslaught of the assimilative force of Hinduism. And on the other, it helped spread Buddhism in Tibet, China, Japan, and other areas of South-East Asia. The monks who survived the attack, fled to these foreign lands taking their books and traditions with them. The fact that Indian kings and traders had already established relations with these countries must have helped then find an easy refuge.
        
        Thus the remains of the Mahavihara at Nalanda, provide important evidence of the developments related to Buddhism, such as the rise of the Mahayana and Vajrayana schools. The great masters and scholars of this institution were the propagators of Buddhism and its practices, around the world.</p>

    <p><b>Modhera Sun Temple  </b></p>
    <p>The Sun Temple of Modhera is a Hindu temple dedicated to the solar deity Surya located at Modhera village of Mehsana district, Gujarat, India. It is situated on the bank of the river Pushpavati. It was built after 1026-27 CE during the reign of Bhima I of the Annhilwara Chalukya / SOLANKI dynasty.</p>
    <p>As per Archeological Survey of India Modhera Sun Temple was built in 1026-27 CE during the reign of Bhima I of the Chaulukya dynasty. As you enter the historical complex, you first come across the magnificent kund known as the Ramakund, built in rectangular shape containing 108 shrines to various gods and demi-gods. Check out the three main shrines positioned on the three sides of the kund, dedicated to Ganesh and Vishnu and an image of Lord Shiva dancing the ‘tandav’. 

        Walk up the steps to the ‘Sabha Mandap’ or the assembly and convene with sculpted renderings of twelve ‘Adityas’ (another name for the sun god). The twelve representations carved on the pillars represent the sun according to the twelve months.
        
        After witnessing the 'Sabha Mandap' a visit to the Garbhagruha will definitely feel as a spiritual experience. The statue of the sun god no longer exists and the Suryavanshi Solanki’s have been scattered into the dust of history since a thousand years but still on the day of the Equinox, one can almost hear the chanting of the prayers, the aroma of incense, the tinkling of bells as the sharp, linear rays of the sun illuminate the inner core of life and light.</p>
