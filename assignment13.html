        <h2>Samosa</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>half kg potatoes</li>
            <li>oil</li>
            <li>salt</li>

        <p><b>Recipe:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>he first step is to cook the potatoes and peas for the savory and spiced filling</li>
            <li>For the stovetop pressure cooker, remove the lid after all the pressure falls in the cooker</li>
            <li>Next, roast or toast the spices.</li>
            <li>Remove the spices from the heat and allow to cool completely. Then, put them in a spice grinder or small mixer-grinder jar</li>
            <li>Grind the toasted spices to a semi-fine powder, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Peel the skin off of the cooked potatoes, and chop them in ½ to 1 inch cubes</li>
            <li>In a small skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil. When the oil becomes medium hot then reduce the heat to low</li>
            <li>Keep the heat on low and add 1 teaspoon finely chopped or minced ginger and 2 teaspoons finely chopped green chillies. Sauté for a few seconds until the raw aroma of ginger goes away</li>
            <li>Now you can switch off the flame or keep flame to a low. Then add the cooked green peas, ½ teaspoon red chilli powder, 1 pinch of asafoetida (hing), the dry ground spice mix that we made and 1 to 2 teaspoons dry mango powder</li>
            <li>Stir together and sauté for a minute. You can add less or more dry mango powder depending upon personal taste</li>
            <li>Next add potato cubes, salt as required and 1 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves (also known as cilantro) to the skillet</li>
            <li>Mix very well and sauté for a minute. Check the taste, and add more of the spices, salt or dry mango powder if needed</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl combine 2 cups all-purpose flour (250 grams), 1 teaspoon carom seeds, 1 teaspoon salt and 6 tablespoons ghee (50 grams).</li>
            <li>Then, working just a bit at a time, add in 7 to 8 tablespoons water in parts and knead.</li>
            <li>Carefully spoon and lightly pack the prepared potato and pea stuffing into the cone</li>
            <li> Evenly press all of the edges, making sure there are no cracks in the dough. The edges should be sealed very well so that the stuffing does not come out while frying</li>
